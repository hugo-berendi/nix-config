Oops, Nix failed to install your new Home Manager profile!

Perhaps there is a conflict with a package that was installed using
"nix-env -i"? Try running

    nix-env -q

and if there is a conflicting package you can remove it with

    nix-env -e {package name}

Then try activating your Home Manager configuration again.
