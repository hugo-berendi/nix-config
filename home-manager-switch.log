The user systemd session is degraded:
  UNIT          LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION
● dunst.service loaded failed failed Dunst notification daemon
● tmux.service  loaded failed failed tmux default session (detached)

Legend: LOAD   → Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
        ACTIVE → The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
        SUB    → The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

2 loaded units listed.
Attempting to reload services anyway...
